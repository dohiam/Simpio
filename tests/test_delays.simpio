;  @brief Basic test of user processing delays
;  @details
;  Unlike PIO instruction delays, user processor delays happen before the
;  instruction executes. The intent is wait until SM instructions get into
;  the desired state before the user program does something.

    PUSH IFFULL          ; now pushes because shift thresh reached
    
    PUSH noblock         ; initially do nothing because FIFO is full (no previous read)
    READ A [2]           ; delay this to allow prev test to finish first
    PUSH noblock         ; now pushes because FIFO is empty
